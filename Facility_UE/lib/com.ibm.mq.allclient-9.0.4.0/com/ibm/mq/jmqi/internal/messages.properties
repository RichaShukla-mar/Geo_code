# Notes for Translators:
# 1) Use of the apostrophe in .properties files
#    If the translated line HAS a substitution block (for example {0}), then two single quotes are
#    required for an apostrophe.
#    If the translated line DOES NOT HAVE a substitution block, then one single quote is required.
#    This is because if a line has a variable {0} then using a single apostrophe will be treated
#    as an escape character and neither the variable or the apostrophe will appear.
# 2) Failures from SEGCHK tool
#    If a strings produces an error from the segmentation checker then a comment
#    has been added  in the # Explanation :  section of the message to help with the translation
#    If many strings in one area cause errors then a block comment has been added before
#    the first error.
