MSG=The library \'&3\' was not found.
XPL=An attempt to dynamically load the library \'&3\' failed because the library was not found. If this an &MQ_long library, it is only available on &MQ_long server installations and is required when the Transfer Certificates (amqtcert) command is used to perform a queue manager operation. If this a GSKit library, it should have been installed during the &MQ_long installation.
URESP=Do not use the command to perform a queue manager operation on a &MQ_long client-only installation. If the command has been made on a &MQ_long server installation, or if it is a GSKit library which is missing, then record the problem identifier, save any generated output files and then use either the &MQ_short Support site http//www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/support/, or IBM Support Assistant (ISA) http//www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/, to see whether a solution is already available. If you are unable to find a match, contact your IBM support center. Do not discard these files until the problem has been resolved.
