MSG=SSL distinguished name does not match peer name, channel \'&3\'.
XPL=The distinguished name, \'&4\', contained in the SSL certificate for the remote end of the channel does not match the local SSL peer name for channel \'&3\'. The distinguished name at the remote host \'&5\' must match the peer name specified (which can be generic) before the channel can be started.
URESP=If this remote system should be allowed to connect, either change the SSL peer name specification for the local channel so that it matches the distinguished name in the SSL certificate for the remote end of the channel, or obtain the correct certificate for the remote end of the channel. Restart the channel.
