MSG=Error accessing CRL LDAP servers; SSL channel \'&3\'.
XPL=CRL checking on LDAP servers has been configured on the local &MQ_short system. An error was found when trying to access the CRL LDAP servers when validating a certificate from the remote system. Possible causes are &B (a) cannot connect to any of the LDAP servers, or &B (b) the certificate issuer\'s Distinguished Name (DN) is not defined in the DIT of an LDAP server. &P The channel is \'&3\'; in some cases its name cannot be determined and so is shown as \'????\'. The channel did not start.
URESP=Check access to the CRL LDAP server(s) you have configured locally. Put right any problems found and restart the channel.
