MSG=The exit buffer address set by the exit is not valid.
XPL=The user exit \'&3\' returned an address \'&1\' for the exit buffer that is not valid, when the secondary response code in the ExitResponse2 field of the channel exit parameters (MQCXP) is set to MQXR2_USE_EXIT_BUFFER. Message AMQ9190 is issued giving more details, and the channel stops.
URESP=Investigate why the user exit program set an exit buffer address that is not valid. The most likely cause is the failure to set a value, so that the value is 0.
