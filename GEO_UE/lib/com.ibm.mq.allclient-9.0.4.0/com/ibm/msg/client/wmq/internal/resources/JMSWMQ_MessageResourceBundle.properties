JMSWMQ1116.useraction = Look at the dead letter header on the message on the dead letter queue to determine why the message could not be processed. 
JMSWMQ1116.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_MESSAGE_ID, XMSC_INSERT_DESTINATION_NAME, XMSC_INSERT_QUEUE_MANAGER_NAME 

JMSWMQ1117 = Message ''{0}'', which was on the queue ''{1}'' on queue manager ''{2}'', cannot be processed and has been discarded.
JMSWMQ1117.explanation = When running in IBM MQ messaging provider normal mode, a message was detected that could not be processed. Because the Report field in the MQMD for this message contained the option MQRO_DISCARD_MSG, the message was discarded. 
JMSWMQ1117.useraction = Modify the applications that are putting messages to the queue specified, so that the Report field in the MQMD for the message contains the option MQRO_DEAD_LETTER_Q. This will ensure that any subsequent messages that cannot be processed will be moved to the dead letter queue rather than being discarded. Messages on the dead letter queue will have a dead letter header, containing information about why the message could not be processed.
JMSWMQ1117.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_MESSAGE_ID, XMSC_INSERT_DESTINATION_NAME, XMSC_INSERT_QUEUE_MANAGER_NAME
