MSG=Channel negotiation failed.
XPL=Channel \'&3\' between this machine and the remote machine \'&4\' could not be established due to a negotiation failure. In some cases the channel name can not be determined and so is shown as \'????\'. &P The last control data received was type &1 with associated error code &2.
URESP=Tell the systems administrator, who should attempt to identify the cause of the channel failure using problem determination techniques. For example, look for FFST files, and examine the error logs on the local and remote systems where there may be messages explaining the cause of failure. More information may be obtained by repeating the operation with tracing enabled.
