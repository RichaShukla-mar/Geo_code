MSG=The program could not bind to a &3 socket.
XPL=The attempt to bind to socket \'&4\' failed with return code &1. The failing &3 call was \'&5\'. The most likely cause of this problem is incorrect configuration of the &3 local address or incorrect start and end port parameters.
URESP=Contact the system administrator. If the problem persists save any generated output files and use either the &MQ_short Support site http//www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/support/, or IBM Support Assistant (ISA) http//www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/, to see whether a solution is already available. If you are unable to find a match, contact your IBM support center.
