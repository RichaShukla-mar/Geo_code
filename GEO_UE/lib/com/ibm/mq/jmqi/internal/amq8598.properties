MSG=Failed to load the &MQ_long native JNI library: \'&3\'.
XPL=The native JNI library \'&3\' could not be loaded because the library was not found. &p \
&p \
The JVM attempted to load the platform native library \'&3\',&p \
which was mapped to the filename: \'&2\'.&p \
&p \
When attempting to load the library, the JVM reported the the error&p \
message:&p \
&1&p \
&p \
The JVM's bit-size is: \'&4\'&p \
&p \
The library path which was used to locate this library was:&p \
&5&p \
&p \
Check that the bit size of the JVM matches the bit size of the first&p \
native library file located within this java.library.path directory&p \
list.&p \
&p \
The native library \'&3\' is used by the &MQ_long classes for &p \
Java and &MQ_long classes for JMS when creating a connection to &p \
the queue manager using a 'bindings' mode connection.  A bindings &p \
mode connection is a connection which uses the system's memory to&p \
communicate with the queue manager, as opposed to a 'client' mode&p \
connection which uses a TCP/IP socket.&p \
&p \
In order to communicate with a queue manager using a bindings mode &p \
connection, the queue manager must be located on the same system as &p \
the &MQ_long classes for Java/JMS.  If this is not the case in&p \
your environment, consider reconfiguring the application to utilise&p \
client mode connections.&p 
URESP=Ensure that the java library path points to the location of the JNI library.
