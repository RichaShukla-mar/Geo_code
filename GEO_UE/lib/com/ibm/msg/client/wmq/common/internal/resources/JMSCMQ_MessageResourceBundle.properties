# JMSCMQ0001 doesn't have a .inserts message because it's only used by Reason in
# a WMQException, and never in a JMSException.
JMSCMQ0001 = IBM MQ call failed with compcode ''{0}'' (''{1}'') reason ''{2}'' (''{3}'').

JMSCMQ0002 = The method ''{0}'' failed.
JMSCMQ0002.explanation = An IBM MQ call failed.
JMSCMQ0002.useraction = Please see the linked exception for more information.
JMSCMQ0002.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_METHOD

JMSCMQ0003 = The destination ''{0}'' not understood or no longer valid.
JMSCMQ0003.explanation = The queue or topic might have become unavailable, the application might be using an incorrect connection for the queue or topic, or the supplied destination is not of the correct type for this method.
JMSCMQ0003.useraction = Check that IBM MQ is still running and the queue manager is available. Check that the right connection is being used for your queue or topic.
JMSCMQ0003.inserts = XMSC_DESTINATION_NAME
JMSCMQ0003.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedInvalidDestinationException

JMSCMQ0004 = The value ''{0}'' was not valid for the property ''{1}''.
JMSCMQ0004.explanation = The value of the property ''{1}'' was none of the valid values for this property.
JMSCMQ0004.useraction = Set the property to a valid value.
JMSCMQ0004.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_VALUE, XMSC_INSERT_PROPERTY

JMSCMQ0005 = The destination name ''{0}'' was not valid.
JMSCMQ0005.explanation = The destination name specified does not conform to published destination syntax.
JMSCMQ0005.useraction = Correct the specified destination name and try again.
JMSCMQ0005.inserts = XMSC_DESTINATION_NAME
JMSCMQ0005.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedInvalidDestinationException

JMSCMQ0006 = The destination is not a temporary destination cannot be deleted.
JMSCMQ0006.explanation = Only temporary destinations can be deleted.

JMSCMQ0007 = An unknown property ''{0}'' with value ''{1}'' was set on the destination property context.
JMSCMQ0007.explanation = The property ''{0}'' was not recognised - it may be a custom property.
JMSCMQ0007.useraction = Ensure that this is intended to be a custom property.
JMSCMQ0007.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_KEY, XMSC_INSERT_VALUE

JMSCMQ0008 = IBM MQ classes for JMS attempts to use a data type not supported by a message or attempts to read data in the wrong type.
JMSCMQ0008.explanation = Wrong data types used to read message property types.
JMSCMQ0008.useraction = Check that the message received and the properties to be read are of the type expected.
JMSCMQ0008.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ0009 = The end of stream has unexpectedly been reached when a stream message or bytes message was read.
JMSCMQ0009.explanation = The byte stream being read is shorter than the buffer supplied. This can also be caused by receiving a corrupt stream message or bytes message.
JMSCMQ0009.useraction = Check the length of buffer supplied. Check system event logs for more detailed information and any other reported failures.
JMSCMQ0009.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageEOFException

JMSCMQ0017 = End of stream.
JMSCMQ0017.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageEOFException

JMSCMQ0018 = A received message could not be correctly parsed.
JMSCMQ0018.explanation = The message with messageID = ''{0}'' and correlationID = ''{1}'' could not be correctly parsed. The last successful data read from the message was at position ''{2}'' in buffer ''{3}''  
JMSCMQ0018.useraction = Examine the message data and ensure that it is of the correct format to be parsed as an MQJMS Message.
JMSCMQ0018.inserts = XMSC_MESSAGE_ID, XMSC_CORRELATION_ID, XMSC_MESSAGE_BUFFER_POSITION, XMSC_MESSAGE_BUFFER

JMSCMQ1000 = Failed to create JMS message.
JMSCMQ1000.explanation = The wrong message type or properties were specified when creating a base message with messageID = ''{0}'' and correlationID = ''{1}''.
JMSCMQ1000.useraction = Check the linked IBM MQ exception reason and completion code for more information and check the log file for detailed message contents.
JMSCMQ1000.inserts = XMSC_MESSAGE_ID, XMSC_CORRELATION_ID

JMSCMQ1006 = The value for ''{0}'':''{1}'' is not valid.

JMSCMQ1044 = String is not a valid hexadecimal number - ''{0}''.
JMSCMQ1044.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_HEX_STRING
JMSCMQ1044.explanation = Either an attempt was made to specify a group ID or correlation ID which starts with the prefix ID but is not followed by a well-formed hexadecimal value, or an attempt was made to receive a message which contains an MQRFH2 property of type bin.hex that does not have a well-formed hexadecimal value.
JMSCMQ1044.useraction = Ensure that a valid hexadecimal value always follows the ID prefix when setting group ID or correlation ID values. Ensure that any MQRFH2 headers generated by non-JMS applications are well-formed.

JMSCMQ1046 = The character set ''{0}'' is not supported.
JMSCMQ1046.inserts = CCSID
JMSCMQ1046.explanation = An attempt was made to send or receive a map message, stream message or text message whose body is encoded using a character set not supported by the JVM. In the case of text messages, this exception might be thrown when the body of the message is first queried, rather than at receive time.
JMSCMQ1046.useraction = Only encode a message using a character set known to be available to the receiving application.

JMSCMQ1047 = The map message has an incorrect format.
JMSCMQ1047.explanation = A map message was received, but its MQRFH2 header information is badly formatted.
JMSCMQ1047.useraction = Ensure any non-JMS applications are building well-formed MQRFH2 header information for inclusion in map messages.
JMSCMQ1047.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1048 = The stream message has an incorrect format.
JMSCMQ1048.explanation = A stream message was received and is badly formatted.
JMSCMQ1048.useraction = Ensure any non-JMS applications are building well-formed stream messages.
JMSCMQ1048.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1049 = The character set ''{0}'' cannot convert some or all of the string ''{1}''
JMSCMQ1049.inserts = CCSID, XMSC_INSERT_VALUE
JMSCMQ1049.explanation = An attempt was made to send or receive string data using a character set not capable of translating the string's content.
JMSCMQ1049.useraction = Only encode a message using a character set known to be appropriate for the string data being transmitted.

JMSCMQ1050 = The MQRFH2 header has an incorrect format.
JMSCMQ1050.explanation = Received a message with a badly formed MQRFH2 header.
JMSCMQ1050.useraction = Ensure that any non-JMS applications building messages with MQRFH2 headers create well-formed MQRFH2 headers.
JMSCMQ1050.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1053 = An incorrect UTF-16 surrogate character ''{0}'' is detected.
JMSCMQ1053.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_CHARACTER
JMSCMQ1053.explanation = A UTF-16 surrogate character was encountered which is not valid as part of a topic name or MQRFH2 property.
JMSCMQ1053.useraction = Ensure that, when specifying UTF-16, topic names or MQRFH2 properties are well-formed.
JMSCMQ1053.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1054 = An incorrect XML escape sequence ''{0}'' is detected.
JMSCMQ1054.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_STRING
JMSCMQ1054.explanation = An XML escape sequence was encountered which is not valid in the MQRFH2 header of a received message.
JMSCMQ1054.useraction = Ensure that only valid XML escape sequences are placed into any MQRFH2 headers built by non-JMS applications.
JMSCMQ1054.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1055 = The property or element in the message has a datatype ''{0}'' incompatible with the method used to access it.
JMSCMQ1055.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_TYPE
JMSCMQ1055.explanation = The accessor method used to retrieved a property from a JMS message, is incompatible with the type of the property being retrieved. For example, attempting to retrieve an integer property using the getBooleanProperty() method.
JMSCMQ1055.useraction = Use an accessor method defined by the JMS specification as being able to retrieve property values of the required type.
JMSCMQ1055.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1056 = The property or element datatype ''{0}'' is unsupported.
JMSCMQ1056.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_TYPE
JMSCMQ1056.explanation = This error is caused by either attempting to set a property of a JMS message using an object which is not one of the supported types or attempting to set or receive a message whose MQRFH2 contains an element representing a property which does not have a valid type associated with it.
JMSCMQ1056.useraction = Ensure that when setting message properties, you use a valid JMS object type. If this exception occurs when receiving a message containing an MQRFH2 header sent by a non-JMS application, ensure that the MQRFH2 header is well-formed.
JMSCMQ1056.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException

JMSCMQ1066 = Unsupported property name ''{0}''.
JMSCMQ1066.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_PROPERTY
JMSCMQ1066.explanation =  Attempted to set a message property using either a property name which is not valid, or the name of a property which cannot have its value set. 
JMSCMQ1066.useraction = Ensure that the property name specified conforms to the JMS specification. If the property name supplied is that of a JMS property, or a vendor specific extension, ensure that this property can be set. 
JMSCMQ1066.exception = com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedMessageFormatException
