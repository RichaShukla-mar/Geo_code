JMSCS0001 = The properties from properties file ''{0}'' could not be loaded because of an IOException.
JMSCS0001.useraction = Check that the properties file exists and has appropriate permissions.
JMSCS0002 = The call could not be completed because CommonServices has not been initialized.
JMSCS0002.explanation = CommonServices is an internal component and needs to be initialized at startup but has failed.
JMSCS0002.useraction = Check that the installation and classpath setup is correct.
JMSCS0003 = A CommonServices component was not found.
JMSCS0003.explanation = CommonServices is an internal component and was not found.
JMSCS0003.useraction = Check that the installation and classpath setup is correct.
JMSCS0004 = A Messaging Provider component was not found.
JMSCS0004.explanation = A request has been made to use a Messaging Provider that is not present in the current configuration.
JMSCS0004.useraction = Check that the JAR file containing the Messaging Provider is present on the classpath or has been registered.
JMSCS0005 = A component was unable to be located by the Component Manager.
JMSCS0005.explanation = A request has been made to use a Component that is not present in the current configuration.
JMSCS0005.useraction = Check that the JAR file containing the Component is present on the classpath or has been registered.
JMSCS0006 = An internal problem occurred. Diagnostic information for service was written to ''{0}''. Please terminate the application as the product is in an inconsistent internal state.
JMSCS0006.useraction = Save any generated output files and use either the WMQ Support site: http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/support/, or IBM Support Assistant (ISA): http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/, to see whether a solution is already available.  If you are unable to find a match, contact your IBM support center.
JMSCS0007 = EXPLANATION:
JMSCS0008 = ACTION:

JMSCS0009 = System properties could not be loaded because of an AccessControlException.
JMSCS0009.explanation = The PropertyStore could not query system properties because the security policy does not allow it.
JMSCS0009.useraction = Modify the security policy to allow system properties to be read.

JMSCS0010 = IBM Messaging Client Common Services could not locate or initialise a component due to exception ''{0}''.
JMSCS0010.inserts = XMSC_INSERT_EXCEPTION

JMSCS0011 = Message
JMSCS0012 = Class
JMSCS0013 = Stack
JMSCS0014 = Caused by [{0}] --> Message
JMSCS0015 = Common object in invalid state

JMSCS0016 = Command Manager operation failed.

JMSC0017 = CommonServices configuration file read from ''{0}''
JMSC0017.inserts = XMSC_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION

JMSCS0018 = Unknown property name supplied ''{0}''
JMSCS0018.inserts = XMSC_PROPERTY_NAME

JMSCS0019 = Property ''{0}'' has already been set by ''{1}''. It can not be updated.
JMSCS0019.inserts = XMSC_PROPERTY_NAME,XMSC_PROPERTY_SOURCE

JMSCS0020 = The class may not be serialized or deserialized as it has not been included in the whitelist ''{0}''.
JMSCS0020.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0021 = The whitelist file ''{0}'' cannot be opened
JMSCS0021.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0022 = The whitelist file ''{0}'' already exists and may not be overwritten
JMSCS0022.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0023 = The whitelist ''{0}'' has an invalid entry
JMSCS0023.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0024 = The whitelist file could not be written

JMSCS0025 = Whitelist ENFORCEMENT enabled - the whitelist file ''{0}'' is being used to validate ObjectMessage serialization and deserialization operations - the whitelist tree is ''{1}''
JMSCS0025.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST,XMSC_WHITELIST_CONTENTS

JMSCS0026 = WhiteList DISCOVERY enabled - The whitelist file ''{0}'' is being used to record ObjectMessage serialization and deserialization operations
JMSCS0026.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0027 = Whitelist ENFORCEMENT enabled - the whitelist ''{0}'' is being used to validate ObjectMessage serialization and deserialization operations
JMSCS0027.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0028 = WhiteList DISCOVERY requested, but the whitelist filename ''{0}'' is not a file URI
JMSCS0028.inserts = XMSC_WHITELIST

JMSCS0029 = No WhiteList functionality enabled - either the properties were not set, or the security permissions prevent them being read
